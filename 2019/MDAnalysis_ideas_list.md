__Description:__ MDAnalysis is a Python library that provides an abstract and object-oriented interface to data from particle-based simulations (primarily molecular dynamics simulations), which are widely used for simulating diverse systems such as the interaction of drugs with biomolecules or new materials. MDAnalysis is widely used in the scientific community and is written by scientists for scientists. Feedback from our users indicates that they like using MDAnalysis but wished that the documentation were easier to read and had more examples. The docs for [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and the [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html) are generally cited as excellent examples of documentation and, taking these as examples, we would like to improve our documentation to make it more accessible and more immediately useful for new users.
