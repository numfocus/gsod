# Organization Profile

## Your details

### Previous Experience with Technical writers or Documentation

NumFOCUS is an umbrella organization for many open source research projects. All
our projects have documentation of various levels of quality. Some projects like
[QuTiP](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/) and
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) have excellent
documentation and tutorials. We strive to continuously improve our documentation
and participate in documentation events as well as organise them in the past.
The numpy and scipy projects have mentors experienced with technical writers in
their day-to-day job but not in an open-source setting. The Shogun project has
participated in 2012 GSoC Doc Camp. The pandas, NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib projects have organized
documentation sprints and participated in the [docathon](https://bids.berkeley.edu/events/docathon). NumFOCUS as
an organisation has also funded documentation projects through its small grants
program in previous years.


### Previous Experience with GSoC and Similar Programs

NumFOCUS and related projects have participated in GSoC for multiple years and
are actively participating this year again. We have successfully mentored more
then 50 students in that time. Due to the scientific nature of most NumFOCUS
sponsored projects many contributors have an academic brackground and are used
to mentor students from a BSc to a PhD level and are experienced in writing for
scientific journals and grant proposals. We are confident that we can provide
excellent support for the technical writers and are looking forward to working
with them.
